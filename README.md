# Uncle-Ernie-Ice-Cream-Parlor
A basic order entering user interface and a database connection using Java Swing Library and JDBC with MySQL

This is a project I made in high school to practice using Java's Swing library as well as the Java Database Connection API (JDBC)
to connect to a local MySQL database on my computer.

That year in high school, I took a Database Fundementals class where I learned about SQL and the basics of database administration and
decided to make a project connecting what I learned about UIs and databases for a "POS" system for "Uncle Ernie" and his "ice cream parlor"
